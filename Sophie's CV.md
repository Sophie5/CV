 
## Sophie McLean 
  
I am a animal loving conservationist who loves to travel. I have recently graduated from Reading University where I studied Biological Sciences.  I am looking for a junior programmer role in a company with a  friendly environment where people are as passionate about coding as I am  and where I could continue to expand my knowledge of coding languages and learn new ones.  
  
## Skills  
  
#### Good communicator 
  
During my time at Battersea Park Children's Zoo I had the chance to interact with other staff members where it was important to make sure you knew what the other staff members were doing as otherwise there was a danger that you might not meet all the animal's requirements or an animal, another staff member or yourself could get hurt. Another part of the role was to effectively communicate with members of the public of all ages. 
  
#### Good team worker 
  
Whilst I was working as a seasonal worker at Sainsbury's I worked with several different groups of people in various areas of the store. I was able to work efficiently with each group of people in order to get our tasks done. 
  
#### Good time manager 
  
During my time at Battersea Park Children's Zoo certain animal enclosures and other general areas in the zoo had to be cleaned before the zoo opened to the public which was an hour after my shift started. By working with other staff members these particular tasks were able to be done every day before the zoo opened. At Sainsbury's we were given certain tasks to finish by the end of a shift working as a team with my fellow coworkers we were able to do this.

  <a href= "https://www.makersacademy.com/about-us/">Makers Academy</a> (February 2016 - May 2016) 

Makers is Europes leading web development bootcamp. It's a highly selective 12 week course. The program adopts a "learn by doing" approach, which is achieved mostly through self-directed, project-based work. We were encouraged to work in pairs on pratical coding challenges, wu=ith weekly tests, culminating in a final project.
